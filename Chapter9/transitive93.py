# Chapter 9, Computer Project 3: Given the matrix representing a relation on a 
# finite set, determine whether the relation is transitive.
# Algorithm for Determining Transitivity:
# 1) Transitive if following True :âˆ€iâˆ€j if (A^2[i][j] = 1) then (A[i][j] = 1)
# Time Complexity: O(n^3) because of normal matrix multiplication. Can be lowered
# to O(n^2.7) using Strassens algorithm for matrix multiplication.
