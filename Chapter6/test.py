    Integer partitions of n, in reverse lexicographic order.
    Note that the generated output consists of the same list object,
    repeated the correct number of times; the caller must leave this
    list unchanged, and must make a copy of any partition that is
    intended to last longer than the next call into the generator.
    The algorithm follows Knuth v4 fasc3 p38 in rough outline.
