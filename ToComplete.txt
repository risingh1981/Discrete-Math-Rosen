Chapter 1:
5. Given positive integers m and n, interactively play the game
of Chomp.
∗6. Given a portion of a checkerboard, look for tilings of this
checkerboard with various types of polyominoes, including
dominoes, the two types of triominoes, and larger polyominoes.

Chapter 2:
6. Given a bijection f from the set {1, 2, . . . , n} to itself, find
f^−1.

Chapter 3: Done

Chapter 4: Do after studying Cryptography
15. Given a message and positive integers a and b less than
26 with gcd(a, 26), encrypt this message using an affine
cipher with key (a, b); and given a message encrypted using
the affine cipher with key (a, b), decrypt this message,
by first finding the decryption key and then applying the
appropriate decryption transformation.
16. Find the original plaintext message from the ciphertext
message produced by encrypting the plaintext message
using a shift cipher. Do this using a frequency count of
letters in the ciphertext.
∗17. Construct a valid RSA encryption key by finding two
primes p and q with 200 digits each and an integere > 1
relatively prime to (p − 1)(q − 1).
18. Given a message and an integer n = pq where p and
q are odd primes and an integer e > 1 relatively prime
to (p − 1)(q − 1), encrypt the message using the RSA
cryptosystem with key (n, e).
19. Given a valid RSA key (n, e), and the primes p and q
with n = pq, find the associated decryption key d.
20. Given a message encrypted using the RSA cryptosystem
with key (n, e) and the associated decryption key d, decrypt
this message.
21. Generate a shared key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
protocol.
22. Given the RSA public and private keys of two parties,
send a signed secret message from one of the parties to
the other.

Chapter 5: Done

Chapter 6: 
*4. Given an equation x1 + x2 +· · ·+xn = C, where C is a
constant, and x1, x2, . . . , xn are nonnegative integers, list
all the solutions. (Do after studying integer partitions.)
