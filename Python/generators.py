** Creating Generators:
>>> nums_squared_lc = [num**2 for num in range(5)]  # Creates a list: [0,1,4,9,16]
>>> nums_squared_gc = (num**2 for num in range(5))  # Creates a generator: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x107fbbc78>
- Generators help keep mem usage low. A list of squares 0-10000 is 87624 bytes, a generator object is 120 bytes.
-  Generators are slower than list comprehension.
    If speed is an issue and memory isnâ€™t, then a list comprehension is likely a better tool for the job.
** Yield Keyword
- Generators based on yield functionality.
- You can use multiple yields within a function. The function will pause at first yield till next is called.
** Advanced Generator Methods: send(), close(), throw()
